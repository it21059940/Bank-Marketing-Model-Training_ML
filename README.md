Problem Addressed
Predicting the likelihood of a bank client subscribing to a term deposit is the main problem addressed here. The dataset has been taken from direct marketing campaigns (primarily phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The campaigns aimed to persuade clients to subscribe to a term deposit, a financial product where money is locked away for a fixed period at a fixed interest rate. The effectiveness of these campaigns is crucial for the bank's marketing strategy and resource allocation. By analyzing and modeling this data, the institution seeks to predict the outcome of future marketing efforts towards individual clients based on historical data and interaction details.

Outcomes of Solving the Problem
•	By predicting which clients are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit, the bank can prioritize its marketing efforts more effectively by targeting only relevant customers, leading to higher conversion rates.
•	Reduces wastage of resources on clients less likely to subscribe, allowing for a more efficient allocation of marketing budgets and personnel, thus leading to resource optimization.
•	This Improves customer experience by reducing unnecessary contacts to uninterested, indirectly benefiting the bank's reputation and client satisfaction.
•	Insights can be gained from the model to form broader business strategies, such as product development and customer service improvements, beyond immediate marketing strategies.
